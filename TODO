Rewrite to read first 2 - 4 bytes, determine encoding, and strip as required.

Generalize to be a wrapper for iconv, autodetecting input encoding and 
generating requested output (defaulting to utf-8)

from vim documentation:
							*bom-bytes*
When reading a file a BOM (Byte Order Mark) can be used to recognize the
Unicode encoding:
	EF BB BF     utf-8
	FE FF        utf-16 big endian
	FF FE        utf-16 little endian
	00 00 FE FF  utf-32 big endian
	FF FE 00 00  utf-32 little endian
